                <h1>Hello! My name is Abby and I am a big foodie. ðŸ˜‹</h1>
                <p>I believe that good food can make a day better. Food can connect people, cultures, and communities together.<br><br>
                    
                In this blog, I will show you some of my favorite foods that I have had eating in and eating out. There will be some of my personal recipes on the <a href = eating-in.html>Eating In</a> page and some food recommendations on the <a href = eating-out.html>Eating Out</a> page, so be sure to check them out!<br><br>

                The <a href = about.html>About</a> page has more about who I am and some of my favorite things, from favorite cuisine to favorite food reality TV.
