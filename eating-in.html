        <h1>My Favorite Foods When Eating In</h1>
        <p class = "desc">I recently started living in an apartment and have had to learn to cook. Here are some of my favorite, easy-to-cook meals that I've made.</p>
    
    
    <div class = "grid">
        <div class = "break">
            <h2>Top Cook-At-Home Meals</h2>
            <p>These recipes are the ones I follow when making these dishes, most of which are learned from my family.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "top"><img src = "images/eating_in/brussel_sprouts.jpeg" alt = "Bowl of roasted brussel sprouts"></div>
        <div class = "item">
            <h2>Air Fryer Brussel Sprouts</h2>
            <p>This recipe is easy, healthy, and tasty. All you need to do is cut the sprouts in half, mix with oil, salt and pepper, and put them in the air fryer for 10 minutes at 374ºF, flipping once in the middle.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class = "top"><img src = "images/eating_in/burrata_salad_home.jpeg" alt = "Bowl of spinach, burrata cheese, tomatoes, and apples"></div>
        <div class = "item">
            <h2>Burrata Salad</h2>
            <p>Burrata salad is taken as inspiration from one of my favorite foods eating out, which is featured on my <a href = "eating-out.html">Eating Out</a> page. My version has spinach, tomatoes, apples, and burrata drizzled with olive oil, balsamic vinegar, salt, and vinegar.</p>
        </div>

        <div class = "top"><img src = "images/eating_in/salmon.jpeg" alt = "Air fried salmon"></div>
        <div class = "item">
            <h2>Salmon</h2>
            <p>Air fried salmon is a fast recipe and a great source of protein. There are many ways to appraoch this, but I will put soy sauce, salt, and pepper on the filet, then air fry it for 25 minutes at 375ºF. Add more time if needed.</p>
        </div>

        <div class = "top"><img src = "images/eating_in/fried_rice.jpeg" alt = "Fried rice with shrimp and vegetables"></div>
        <div class = "item">
            <h2>Fried Rice</h2>
            <p>Fried rice is a classic Chinese dish. It is super customizable (add choice of protein, if any) and is great with leftover rice. I like to fry my rice with peas, corn, and carrots, adding soy sauce, oyster sauce, salt, and pepper to taste.</p>
